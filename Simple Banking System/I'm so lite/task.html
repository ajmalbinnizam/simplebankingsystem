<h2> Description</h2>

<p>It's very upsetting when the data about registered users disappears after the program is completed. To avoid this problem, you need to create a database where you will store all the necessary information about the created credit cards. We will use SQLite to create the database.</p>

<p>SQLite is a database engine. It is software that allows users to interact with a relational database. In SQLite, a database is stored in a single file — a trait that distinguishes it from other database engines. This allows for greater accessibility: copying a database is no more complicated than copying the file that stores the data, and sharing a database implies just sending an email attachment.</p>

<p>You can use the <code class="language-java">sqlite3</code> module to manage SQLite database from Python. You don't need to install this module. It is included in the standard library.</p>

<p>To use the module, you must first create a <code class="language-java">Connection</code> object that represents the database. Here the data will be stored in the <code class="language-java">example.s3db</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.s3db')</code></pre>

<p>Once you have a <code class="language-java">Connection</code>, you can create a <code class="language-java">Cursor</code> object and call its <code class="language-java">execute()</code> method to perform SQL queries:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">cur = conn.cursor()

# Executes some SQL query
cur.execute('SOME SQL QUERY')

# After doing some changes in DB don't forget to commit them!
conn.commit()</code></pre>

<p>To get data returned by SELECT query you can use <code class="language-java">fetchone()</code>, <code class="language-java">fetchall()</code> methods:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">cur.execute('SOME SELECT QUERY')

# Returns the first row from the response
cur.fetchone()

# Returns all rows from the response
cur.fetchall()</code></pre>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, create a database named <code class="language-java">card.s3db</code> with a table titled <code class="language-java">card</code>. It should have the following columns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>id INTEGER</li>
	<li>number TEXT</li>
	<li>pin TEXT</li>
	<li>balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0</li>
</ul>

<p>Pay attention: your database file should be created when the program starts if it hasn’t yet been created. And all created cards should be stored in the database from now.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">Do not forget to commit your DB changes right after executing a query!</div></p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The symbol <code class="language-java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Notice that it's not a part of the input.</p>
