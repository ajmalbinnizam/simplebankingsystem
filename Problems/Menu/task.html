  <p>Let's say you were asked to create a program for a restaurant: a visitor enters what kind of food they would like to order and gets back the restaurant's offer.</p> 
  <p>The restaurant has just opened so its menu contains only a few options:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>pizza: Margherita, Four Seasons, Neapolitan, Vegetarian, Spicy</li> 
   <li>salad: Caesar salad, Green salad, Tuna salad, Fruit salad</li> 
   <li>soup: Chicken soup, Ramen, Tomato soup, Mushroom cream soup</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If the visitors ask for something that is not on the menu, the program should write "Sorry, we don't have it in the menu".</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:</strong> <code class="java">"pizza"</code><br> <strong>Output:</strong> <code class="java">"Margherita, Four Seasons, Neapolitan, Vegetarian, Spicy"</code></p> 
  <p><strong>Input:</strong> <code class="java">"burger"</code><br> <strong>Output:</strong> <code class="java">"Sorry, we don't have it in the menu"</code></p>
