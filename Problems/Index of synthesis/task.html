  <p>One way to classify the languages of the world is by looking at their morphological systems. One classification is based on the <strong>index of synthesis </strong>that reflects the average number of morphemes in a word. The values vary between 1 and 4 and there are 3 types of languages according to that system. Here they are:</p> 
  <p><strong>Type — Index</strong></p> 
  <p>Analytic — less than 2</p> 
  <p>Synthetic — from 2 to 3 (inclusively)</p> 
  <p>Polysynthetic — more than 3</p> 
  <p>Write a program that given the index of synthesis determines the type of the language.</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The value of the index of synthesis.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The type of language.</p>
