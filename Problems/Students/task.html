  <p>John works at the university. He deals with the information about a lot of students and he decided to create a program that would help him with it. </p> 
  <p>He devised a system for creating an <strong>id</strong> for each student: first letter of the name, last name, and then the birth year. For example, the id for John Smith (b. 1989) would look like <code class="java">JSmith1989</code>.</p> 
  <p>John needs help finishing the code for the id and then applying it to the students. Your task is to define an instance attribute <code class="java">student_id</code><strong> </strong>in the <code class="java">__init__</code> method, calculate it, create an object of the class <code class="java">Student</code> with the <strong>parameters from the input</strong>, and print the value of the id. Do NOT print the value inside of the <code class="java">__init__</code> method!</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>Student information: the first line has <strong>the name</strong>, the second line has <strong>the last name</strong>, and the third has <strong>the birth year</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The <code class="java">student_id</code><strong> </strong>of the student.</p> 
  <p>NOTE: the attribute names are case sensitive, so check that the attribute is named exactly <code class="java">student_id</code>. Other names lead to an <code class="java">AttributeError</code>!</p>
